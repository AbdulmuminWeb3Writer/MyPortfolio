							<h2>Bridging the gap between Users and Web3 Tech
						</header>
						<p style="text-align: justify;">
							Marketing content, advertising copies, and press releases often dive into technical jargon, describing products as 'built on Solana network with a pitch of Solidity and touch of smart contract, utilizing interoperability and immutability features of blockchain.' <u>But who truly understands these terms?</u><br/>
						
							Operating at the intersection of Web3 technology and user comprehension, I specialize in demystifying complex technical concepts for a wider audience. My approach hinges on breaking down intricate Web3 and blockchain principles into digestible, accessible narratives without compromising accuracy or context. By bridging the gap between users and technical jargon, I strive to make the intricacies of Web3 technology more understandable and approachable for all.</p>
